# Didlydoo Project 

Group project which the goal was to create an event planner via a local storage given by our coach.

## Resume

We had to consume the API and fetch the data given by the server, and display them.

The idea of the project planner was to be able to create a new event, by giving a title name, an author, multiple dates and a description of the event.

All the events can be deleted and modified.

The next step was to display the different events with the different dates.

Finally, the trickiest part was to be able to add an user who would be able to give his availabilities.

### Difficulties

We came accross different difficulties through this project. 

The first was working with a local server and understang the different methods to get the datas.

The second was to use the different methods in the right way to be able to display the different elements we wanted to display.

We were able to mostly complete this project even though it could be better and more finished.
